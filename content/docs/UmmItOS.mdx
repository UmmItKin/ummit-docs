View the source code and latest updates: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UmmItKin/Dotfiles)

## Installation

This guide covers the complete setup process for UmmItOS dotfiles and configurations.

### Prerequisites

- Target audience: Newcomers to Hyprland and heavy user of Arch Linux
- System: Arch Linux or Arch-based distribution (EndeavourOS also nice)
- Required: `git` and `paru` (will be installed automatically if missing with the setup script)

### About This Documentation

This documentation provides detailed explanations and guidelines for understanding and using the UmmItOS dotfiles. It serves as the primary reference and is updated more frequently than the repository README.

### Quick Installation

Use the automated installation script:

```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UmmItKin/Dotfiles/main/setup.sh)
```

The setup script automatically checks for `git` and `paru` dependencies and installs them if needed, then clones the dotfiles repository and copies configurations to your system.

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, clone the repository and run the installation script manually:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/UmmItKin/Dotfiles.git
cd Dotfiles
./install.sh
```

> **Note**: Cloning with submodules includes the wallpaper repository for default wallpapers.

### Installation Process

The installation script performs the following steps:

1. **Required Packages**: Installs necessary packages for the dotfiles
2. **GPU Detection**: Automatically detects and installs AMD GPU packages if applicable  
3. **Laptop Detection**: Installs laptop-specific packages when running on laptop hardware
4. **Configuration Copy**: Copies all configurations to `~/.config`

Each step can be skipped individually for modular installation.

> **Note**: Package installation uses `paru` as the package manager.

## Configuration

### Terminal Startup

To display Fastfetch when starting the terminal, add the following line to your shell configuration file (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):

```shell
