## Overview

UmmItOS provides two ways to install: the quick script and manual installation

- **Quick Installation**: Use the automated installation script (Recommended)
- **Manual Installation**: Clone the repository and run the installation script manually (For advanced users who only want to install certain parts of the dotfiles)

## Quick Installation

Quick Installation is the recommended way to install UmmItOS. It will install all the necessary packages and copy the configurations to your system. We also provide a post-install script to help you configure your system.

You can simply run the automated installation script:

```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UmmItKin/Dotfiles/main/setup.sh)
```

The setup script automatically checks for `git` and `paru` dependencies and installs them if needed, then clones the dotfiles repository and copies configurations to your system.

### Installation Process

The installation script performs the following steps, **each step is optional and can be skipped individually for modular installation.**

1. **Required Packages**: Installs necessary packages for the dotfiles
2. **GPU Detection**: Automatically detects and installs AMD GPU packages if applicable  
3. **Laptop Detection**: Installs laptop-specific packages when running on laptop hardware
4. **Configuration Copy**: Copies all configurations to `~/.config`
5. **Post-Install Script**: Runs the post-install script to help you configure your system

<Callout type="info">Package installation uses `paru` as the package manager.</Callout>

## Manual Installation (CLI)

Manual Installation allows you to install UmmItOS manually by cloning the repository and running the installation script yourself.

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --shallow-submodules --recursive https://github.com/UmmItKin/Dotfiles.git
cd Dotfiles
./install.sh
```

<Callout type="info">Cloning with submodules includes the wallpaper repository for default wallpapers.</Callout>

The `[y/n]` prompt will ask you to confirm the installation. You can press `y` to confirm the installation or `n` to skip it and follow the steps manually.

## Experimental TUI Installation (Not finish.)

You can try our new Terminal User Interface for a more interactive experience:

```bash
./install-menu.sh
```

<Callout type="warning">The TUI installation is currently in experimental phase. Copying file still be under development.</Callout>
