# Hyprshot Configuration

Hyprshot handles screenshot functionality in UmmItOS and requires proper directory configuration.

## Configuration File

The configuration file is located at `./configs/hypr/hyprland/launcher.conf` where you can modify the screenshot directory location.

Around line 32, you can modify the screenshot directory. Our post-install script will help you configure the screenshot directory, or you can manually edit the file. For example: 

```shell
bind = $mainMod, PRINT, exec, hyprshot -m window
bind = , PRINT, exec, hyprshot -m output
bind = $shiftMod, PRINT, exec, hyprshot -m region -z
```

## Screenshot Directory

The path comes from the `./configs/hypr/hyprland/env.conf` file. Around line 23, you can modify the path to your liking. For example:

```shell
env = HYPRSHOT_DIR,/home/username/Pictures/Screenshots
```

<Callout type="info">You will need to use an absolute path (full path) for the screenshot directory, not a relative path.</Callout>

After changing this path, **you will need to relogin to apply the changes. Without relogin, the path will not be applied.**
