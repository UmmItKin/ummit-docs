## Customization

To modify laptop-specific keybindings:

1. **Edit the configuration file**
2. **Adjust the increment values** (e.g., change `1%` to `5%` for faster changes)
3. **Add custom laptop-specific shortcuts**
4. **Test the changes** after reloading configuration

### Example Custom Configuration

```shell
# Custom brightness control (5% increments)
bind = , XF86MonBrightnessUp, exec, brightnessctl set +5%
bind = , XF86MonBrightnessDown, exec, brightnessctl set 5%-

# Custom volume control (2% increments)
bindel = , XF86AudioRaiseVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 2%+
bindel = , XF86AudioLowerVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 2%-
```
